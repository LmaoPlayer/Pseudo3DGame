# Pseudo 3D Game
>This project was heavily inspired by [Coder Space's Doom Wolfenstein tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ).

## What
This is a project that will not end up being a finished game. It is simply a sandbox/simulation game made for experimentational purposes in .NET's form application framework and that was originally for a school project. The current features are:
- Wall Collision.
- 2D/3D perspectives.
- Texturing with texture packs.
- Map uploading and saving.
- Random map generation.
- Custom map generation using .csv files in and out of the game.

## Controls
- ZQSD: Walk forward, left, backwards, right in this order.
- CTRL+Z: Sprint forward.
- Arrow left, right, up, down: rotate in said directions, also works with mouse movement.
- R+P+ENTER: Easter egg: Look in the corner of your eye.
- Escape: Opens/Closes escape menu. Due to the escape menu being layered it will simply return to a previously established layer.
- L: Changes 3D to 2D and the other way around.
