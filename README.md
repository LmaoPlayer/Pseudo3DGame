# Pseudo 3D Game
>This project was heavily inspired by [Coder Space's Doom Wolfenstein tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ).

## What
This is a simple 3D simulation built in .NET's windows forms application. This features:
- Wall Collision
- 2D/3D perspectives
- Texturing with texture packs
- Map uploading and saving

## Controls
- ZQSD: Walk forward, left, backwards, right in this order.
- CTRL+Z: Sprint forward.
- Arrow left, right, up, down: rotate in said directions, also works with mouse movement.
- R+P+ENTER: Easter egg
- Escape: Opens/Closes escape menu. Due to the escape menu being layered it will simply return to a previously established layer.
- L: Changes 3D to 2D and the other way around.

## Final notice
This is not a project that will end up being a game. It is simply a sandbox/simulation game made for experimentational purposes.
